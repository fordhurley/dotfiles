ford's dotfiles
================

Run `./link.sh` to add symlinks to `$HOME`.


Brewfile
---------

`Brewfile` was manually created and has been partially maintained with packages
I install on new machines. `Brewfile.gen` was created recently by running
`brew bundle dump`.


powerline-shell
----------------

I installed [this version](https://github.com/b-ryan/powerline-shell/tree/a9b8c9bb39).
Just need to `pip install powerline-shell`. My configuration is linked to `$HOME`
by `link.sh`.
